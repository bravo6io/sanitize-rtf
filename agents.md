# Purpose
Simplifies Word-generated `.rtf` files so SketchUp Layout renders lists reliably in construction document notes.

# Development Rules / Guidelines
- Always leave code comments (especially for complex code, such as string manipulations and regex usages)

# Quick Usage
```bash
node batch_simplify_rtf.js --dir test_files --styles styles.tsv
```

See `README.md` for full usage, setup, and file behavior details.
